Working on this documentation
#############################

If you want to help the project by working on documentation, this is the tutorial on how to start!

==============
Pre-requisites
==============

* Fork the `ZPUI repository`_ on GitHub
* Create a separate branch for your documentation needs
* Install the necessary Python packages for testing the documentation locally:

    ``pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild sphinx-rtd-theme``

.. _ZPUI repository: https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/

======================
Find a task to work on
======================

* Look into `ZPUI GitHub issues`_ and see if there are issues concerning documentation
* Unleash your inner perfectionist

.. _ZPUI GitHub issues: https://github.com/ZeroPhone/ZPUI/issues

============================
Testing your changes locally
============================

You can build the documentation using ``make html``. Then, you can run:

    ``cd _build/html && python -m SimpleHTTPServer``

and connect to your computer on port 8000 to see your changes. 

.. note:: ``SimpleHTTPServer`` needs to run in the directory where the HTML files are located (``_build/html``), so you might need at least three different console windows open - one for editing, one for triggering documentation builds and one for SimpleHTTP server. I, personally, use tmux for that.
